The overall design, rationale, objectives, and initial results of this intervention study have been published (Ann Epidemiol 1994 Jan;4(1):1-10). Briefly, this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, primary prevention trial to determine whether daily supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung or other cancers among male smokers.\n\nA total of 29,133 men between the ages of 50 and 69 years, who smoked at least five cigarettes per day, were recruited from southwestern Finland between 1985 and 1988, and randomly assigned to one of four groups based on a 2x2 factorial design. Men who had prior cancer or serious illness or who reported current use of vitamins E (>20 mg/day), A (>20,000 IU/day), or beta-carotene (>6 mg/day) were ineligible. Participants received either alpha-tocopherol (50 mg/day) as dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, beta-carotene (20 mg/day) as all-trans-beta-carotene, both supplements, or placebo capsules for 5 to 8 years (median 6.1 years) until death or trial closure (April 30, 1993).\n\nThe study was approved by the institutional review boards of the NCI and the National Public Health Institute of Finland, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant before randomization. Post-intervention follow-up has continued through the Finnish Cancer Registry with data currently available through 2015. Analyses based on biospecimens and questionnaire data collected during the parent study are ongoing and focus on the roles of micronutrients, diet, energy balance and growth factors, genetic variants, and other factors in prostate, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, kidney, bladder, upper gastrointestinal, lymphatic, and other cancers.',2,1,'','',29133,1985,1988,0,-1,-1,50,69,57,57,'Baseline and annually until 1993',1993,1,0,1,0,0,'',0,'',0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,'','2017-07-13 04:00:00','2017-07-13 04:00:00',2),(14,'Women\'s Health Initiative','WHI','http://www.whi.org/','Megan Herndon','Data Operations Study Coordinator','(206) 667-7271','','','','','',1,'Garnet Anderson','Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center','garnet@whi.org','Rebecca Jackson','Ohio State University','rebecca.jackson@osumc.edu','Sally Shumaker','Wake Forest University','Sshumake@wakehealth.edu','Jean Wactawski-Wende','University of Buffalo','jww@buffalo.edu','Marcia Stefanick','Stanford University','stefanick@stanford.edu','','','','Garnet Anderson','WHI CCC PI','(206) 667-4699','garnet@whi.org, or helpdesk@whi.org',0,0,1,'URLs too long for this space - URLs included in submission email.',0,0,'\nThe Women\'s Health Initiative (WHI) is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. These chronic diseases are the major causes of death, disability, and frailty in older women of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nThis multi-million dollar, 20-year project, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), NHLBI, involves 161,808 women aged 50 to 79, and is one of the most definitive, far-reaching clinical trials of postmenopausal women\'s health ever undertaken in the United States. The WHI Clinical Trial and Observational Study focused on many of the inequities in women\'s health research and will continue to provide practical information to women and their physicians about hormone therapy, dietary patterns, calcium/vitamin D supplementation, and their effects on the prevention of heart disease, cancer, and osteoporotic fractures.\n\nThe WHI has two major parts: a randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS). The randomized controlled CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50 and 79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:\n\n  -Hormone Therapy Trials (HT): This component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component took hormone pills or a placebo (inactive pill) until the Estrogen plus Progestin and Estrogen Alone trials were stopped early in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out.\n  -Dietary Modification Trial (DM): The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable, and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants followed either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern.\n  -Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD): This component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component took calcium and vitamin D pills or a placebo.\n',1,2,'','generally healthy/prior cancer diagnoses ok',161808,1993,1998,0,-1,-1,50,79,63,63,'Medical History updates were collected annually from baseline to present.',2017,1,1,1,0,0,'',1,'DXA scan, balance beam scale, stadiometer, hydraulic dynamometer, MACPC personal cardiograph, sphygmomanometer ',0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,'','2017-07-13 04:00:00','2017-07-13 04:00:00',2),(15,'Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study','GSSFHS','www.generationscotland.org','Archie Campbell','Project Manager','+44 131 651 8740','archie.campbell@igmm.ed.ac.uk','','','','',1,'David Porteous','University of Edinburgh','david.porteous@ed.ac.uk','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','',1,0,1,'www.gsaccess.org',0,0,'The Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) is an intensively phenotyped, family-based cohort for the study of the genetic basis of common complex diseases and response to treatments.

This cohort will enable questions about diet and cancer to be addressed that are not easily answered with other study populations. About half of Adventists are vegetarian (about 8-9% vegan) and others eat meat with varying frequency.\n\nTaking advantage of the unusual dietary habits of Adventists, the special focus of this research is to investigate associations between soy intake, long chain fatty acids, dairy, meats, calcium intake, and cancers of the breast, prostate, and colon. About half of black and white Adventists consume quantities of soy similar to the China or Singapore population. Adventists also vary widely in their intake of calcium and dairy products. \n\nThe very high incidence and mortality ascribed to prostate cancer in black men may be associated with their dietary habits. The investigators have completed a substantial amount of pilot work with black Adventists. In the past, however, they had not yet successfully established a cohort of black members. Cohort members were enrolled church-by-church using a pretested plan whereby institutional media and respected members at individual churches promoted the study. Participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire that was pretested.\n\nCancer surveillance during follow-up is by matching with state tumor registries where possible, matching with the National Death Index, and by obtaining and coding hospitalization records as necessary. Calibration studies in both black and white Adventists will allow bias correction. The investigators believe that it is important to also gather blood, urine, and subcutaneous fat from the study participants, and have a completed representative calibration study (n=1,011) to accomplish this.\n\nThe Adventist population has cooperated with epidemiologic investigators for many years and has some unusual strengths as a research population, including the virtual absence of confounding by tobacco and alcohol, the wide range of dietary habits, and the widespread use of soy products.

At enrollment, the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort included 184,194 men and women from the CPS-II Baseline Cohort who were aged 40-93 years and resided in 21 states with population-based state cancer registries. Since 1997, this sub-cohort has been re-contacted by mail biennially to obtain self-reported information on newly diagnosed cancers and additional exposure information. Self-reported cancer diagnoses are verified by medical record review. Linkage with state cancer registries is used when medical records cannot be obtained. The vital status of study participants is updated biennially through linkage with the NDI. In 1998, the CPS-II LifeLink Cohort was initiated to obtain blood samples from surviving members of the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort in 20 states who resided near blood collection centers at 312 collaborating community hospitals in urban or suburban areas. Blood samples were provided by 39,380 cohort members (30.5% of invited participants). Collection began in 1998 and was completed in 2001. The CPS-II Buccal Cell Cohort was initiated to obtain mouthwash (buccal cell) samples by mail from Nutrition Cohort participants who were unable (for geographic reasons) or unwilling to give a blood sample. Collection began in 2001 and was completed in 2002. Buccal cell samples were received from 70,004 participants (55% of invited participants).

All women had a 4-view screening mammogram at the time of enrollment and completed a self-administered questionnaire. A majority of the cohort (14,141) also had blood available from their routine blood work, which was saved as a source of buffy coat, or DNA, and plasma. A total of 2,284 cohort participants had a history of cancer other than of the breast. Therefore, the investigators defined a healthy cohort as the 17,639 women who were free of a history of any cancer at baseline (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer).\n\nFollow-up for all incident cancers is performed annually using linkages to Mayo Clinic databases and the tri-state cancer registries. For those participants who have moved out of the region, the investigators use self-report, with pathology confirmation. As of July 2016, the total number of incident cancers in the healthy cohort was 2041, of which 829 were breast cancers.\n\nThe MMHS was designed to answer questions surrounding mammographic breast density, a strong risk factor for breast cancer. Analyses to date have used a case-cohort approach, in which the investigators have identified a random sample of 2,300 women from the cohort at baseline. As a part of the case-cohort design, all incident breast cancer cases are included. Mammographic density has been estimated using the Cumulus program on the enrollment mammogram from all participants in the case-cohort.

Over 30 years and more than 400 published research reports later, it continues as a prospective cohort study.\n\nPHS I is a landmark clinical trial that began in the fall of 1982, with the aim of testing the benefits and risks of aspirin and beta-carotene in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer in 22,071 men initially aged 40-84 years. The trials finding in 1988 that low-dose aspirin decreased the risk of a first myocardial infarction by 44% came ahead of the scheduled timeline for completion and helped focus on the role of aspirin in primary prevention of coronary heart disease. The beta-carotene component of the trial, which continued uninterrupted until the studys scheduled termination in 1995, showed no statistically significant benefit or harm after 12 years of supplementation with regard to malignant cancers, cardiovascular disease or mortality. \n\nPHS II, began in 1997 with the aim of testing the balance of benefits and risks of beta-carotene in conjunction with three widely used supplements  vitamin E, vitamin C, and a multivitamin  in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, age-related eye disease, and cognitive decline in 14,641 men initially aged 50+ years, including 7,641 PHS I participants and 7,000 newly recruited male physicians. It was decided in 2003 that, based on two decades worth of data contributed by PHS participants, beta-carotene did not reduce the risk of total cardiovascular disease, total cancer, or total mortality, nor did it impact cognitive performance. The vitamin C and vitamin E components ended as planned in 2007, and these vitamin supplements did not prevent major cardiovascular events, cancer, or eye disease. The multivitamin component ended as planned in 2011, for which those taking a multivitamin had modest but significant reduction in cancer and cataract, and no overall effect on major cardiovascular events, age-related macular degeneration, or cognitive decline. \n\nWhile the PHS I and II clinical trials have ended, observational follow-up of the PHS cohort continues.

The underlying rationale for the trial is that screening for cancer may enable doctors to discover and treat the disease earlier. Numerous epidemiologic and ancillary studies are included to answer related crucial questions.\n\nTogether, these four cancers are estimated to account for about 40 percent of all diagnosed cancers in the United States and 45 percent of cancer deaths in 2009.\n\nSponsored and run by NCIs Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), in collaboration with the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), the PLCO Trial is taking place at ten screening centers across the country.\n\nBetween 1992, when the trial opened, and by 2001, when enrollment ended, 155,000 women and men between the ages of 55 and 74 who had no previous diagnosis of cancer of the prostate, lung, colon/rectum, or ovary had joined. At entry, participants were randomly divided into one of two study groups. One group received routine health care from their health providers. The other group received a series of exams to screen for prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers. Screening of participants ended in late 2006. Active follow-up is continuing for up to 14 years as originally scheduled, with an additional follow-up for at least five years being planned. New findings are noted as they are published on the  PLCO News Updates and Publications.\n\nWith more than 2.6 million biological samples collected, the PLCO Trial is a rich and unique resource for etiologic and early marker studies. The Etiology and Early Marker Studies (EEMS) program is a critical component of the PLCO Trial.

PCPT was a double-blind placebo controlled phase III trial that randomized 18,880 eligible participants from sites in the U.S. and Canada. At study entry, men had a normal digital rectal exam (DRE) and a PSA ≤ 3.0 ng/dl. The men underwent annual DREs and measurements of PSA that were processed at a central lab. AUA symptom scores, clinically significant medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular outcomes, other cancers) and side effects were recorded. An extensive diet questionnaire was administered after the first year on study. Prostate biopsies were recommended during the trial for men with either an elevated PSA (> 4.0 ng/ml adjusted) or DRE suspicious for cancer. All men were recommended to have an end of study (EOS) biopsy regardless of their PSA level or DRE result. Tissue from all prostate biopsies was submitted to the Pathology Core Laboratory. Serum was collected annually and there was a white blood collection for which approximately 60% of the participants with a prostate cancer endpoint have a sample. The PCPT was stopped 15 months earlier than planned. Among the 9060 men who either had an interim diagnosis of prostate cancer or an end of study biopsy, there was a 24.8% relative risk reduction in prostate cancer was observed with finasteride. However, tumors of Gleason grade 7-10 were more common in the finasteride group. All participant contact ended in June 2004. \n\nIn 2012, an analysis on the survival of the participants was performed.  Updated survival information was obtained from the Social Security Death Index which does not include cause of death.  The paper concluded that after 18 years of follow-up there was no significant difference in survival between the placebo and finasteride group either overall or after the diagnosis of prostate cancer.  \n\nWithin the PCPT there is a nested case-control study.  A total of 1,809 cases of prostate cancer with available baseline serum included in this project. Approximately 40% of our cases are interim and 60% are cases detected at the end-of-study biopsy.  The 1,809 controls were randomly selected from men who completed the EOS prostate biopsy and had no evidence of prostate cancer.  Controls included all eligible non-white men (primarily African-Americans and Hispanics), to better support exploratory analyses in these subgroups.  Remaining controls were frequency matched to cases by distributions of age at randomization, in 5-year intervals, first-degree family history of prostate cancer (established risk factors for prostate cancer), and intervention arm.  By oversampling the non-white men and matching on the factors listed above, the estimated race-specific odds ratios for prostate cancer are not interpretable.  The case-control study looked at genetic, metabolic and environmental factors associated with the risks of prostate cancer overall and high grade prostate cancer specifically; and the effects of these factors on the efficacy of finasteride as a cancer preventive agent.

Every two years, study participants receive questionnaires to collect information about diseases and health-related topics like smoking, physical activity, and medications taken. The questionnaires that ask detailed dietary information are administered in four-year intervals. There are also biorepositories for several members of the cohort including blood, DNA, tumor tissue, and toenail specimens.',2,2,'','Health Professionals',51529,1986,1988,0,-1,-1,40,75,54,54,'Bienially 1986-2014, 2016 questionnaire collection is on-going',2016,0,1,1,1,0,'',1,'tape measure for waist, hip circumference',0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,'','2017-07-24 04:00:00','2017-07-24 04:00:00',2),(62,'Singapore Chinese Health Study','SCHS','','Jian-Min Yuan','PI','412-864-7889','yuanj@upmc.edu','','','','',1,'Jian-Min Yuan','University of Pittsburgh','yuanj@upmc.edu','Woon-Puay Koh','National University of Singapore','woonpuay.koh@duke-nus.edu.sg','','','','','','','','','','','','','Jian-Min Yuan','PI','412-864-7889','yuanj@upmc.edu',1,0,0,'',1,0,'The Singapore Chinese Health Study is a residential cohort of 63,257 middle-aged and older (45 to 74 years of age) Singapore Chinese men and women accrued between 1993 and 1998.

Interviews were completed on 52,326 subjects, representing a consent rate of over 90%.\n\nRight after the first follow-up interview, we collected blood and urine samples from all consented cohort participants. From 2000 to 2005, we collected biological specimens from 32,543 subjects (28,330 bloods, 4,400 buccal cells, 31,895 urines), representing a consent rate of approximately 60 percent of surviving cohort participants. \n\nFrom 2006 to 2010, we conducted a second telephone follow-up interview to update information on subject\'s change on smoking, dietary, and other lifestyles, body weight, physical exercise, use of medication and medical history.

We have assessed these new measures on 17,107 subjects that provided data resources for research on aging and healthy living and disease outcomes including cancer.\n\nThe cohort has been followed for death, cancer occurrence, and other major health outcome occurrences through regular record linkage with the population-based Singapore Cancer Registry, the Singapore Registry of Births and Deaths, and the Singapore National Hospital Discharge Data System, as well as through follow-up interviews for outcomes that are not registered nationally or hospitalized for treatment. The observed numbers of incident cancers and deaths within the cohort are comparable to corresponding expected numbers based on age- and sex-specific incidence rates for all Chinese in Singapore. So far less than 1% of original cohort participants migrated out of Singapore, thus were lost to the follow-up for incident death and cancer occurrences.

The CTS was established by epidemiological investigators at City of Hope, the University of Southern California, the University of California at Irvine, and the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. The overall goal of the CTS is to generate new knowledge about breast cancer, other cancers, and women\'s health that can lead to better prevention and improved health outcomes.\n\nCTS participants have been followed continuously since 1995. Annual newsletters communicate study news and maintain participants\' interest in the cohort. We have gathered new and updated exposure and lifestyle information through four additional mailed self-administered questionnaires. Our sixth study-wide survey is being administered both online and in paper, beginning in 2017. Follow-up of the cohort includes routine linkage with the California Cancer Registry, which is more than 99 percent complete for new cancers diagnosed among CTS participants who reside in California (the vast majority of CTS residents live in California).  We annually link the CTS with the State of California hospital discharge database, which provides information on all discharge diagnoses and procedures that are performed on CTS participants living in the state. Mortality follow-up via linkages with California mortality files, the Social Security Death Index, and the National Death Index provides detailed mortality data, including cause of death, for the entire CTS population. We have linked the CTS with statewide databases of detailed environmental exposures that enable individual-level analysis of a range of directly measured environmental exposures. Biospecimens collected by a number of projects during follow-up have generated a biobank of 35,166 samples (primarily blood & saliva) from 32,504 participants. The CTS has developed innovative new approaches for building and maintaining our core infrastructure. We have leveraged cloud computing and mobile technology to, in a HIPAA-compliant manner, better manage our CTS data, collect new biospecimen data, introduce electronic consent, adhere to best-practices biospecimen collections, eliminate preanalytical variability of the blood samples we collect, administer individually customized questionnaires to participants, and collaborate and communicate study-wide in real-time.

EPIC was established primarily to investigate the role of nutrition in cancer development and the multi-country design was intended to capture variation in diet and lifestyle habits across Western European countries. Detailed information on diet, lifestyle characteristics, anthropometric measurements, and reproductive and medical history was collected at recruitment. Biological samples including plasma, serum, leukocytes, and erythrocytes were also collected at baseline from 387,889 individuals and are stored at the International Agency for Research on Cancer  World Health Organization (IARC-WHO) and mirrored at EPIC collaborating centres. EPIC is jointly coordinated by Imperial College London (Professor Elio Riboli) and IARC (Drs Marc Gunter and Paul Brennan) and is governed by a steering committee comprising representatives from each EPIC centre. Follow-up of study participants is coordinated by the individual EPIC centres through cancer registry linkage or active follow-up and data is centralized at IARC. Since recruitment, approximately 62,000 EPIC participants have been diagnosed with cancer including 16,000 breast cancers, 6,500 colorectal cancers, 5,000 lung cancers, 1,500 pancreatic cancers and 500 liver cancers. As a consortium EPIC has produced more than 800 scientific articles with numerous additional publications originating from the individual participating EPIC cohorts. Notable sub-studies within EPIC include EPIC-Interact and EPIC-CVD  case-cohort studies to investigate the etiology of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, respectively; EPIC-PANACEA  a study of the causes of weight gain and obesity, and NeuroEPIC4PD which has a focus on Parkinsons and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n',0,1,'','',521324,1992,2000,0,-1,-1,35,70,52,-1,'Baseline, follow-up every 3-4 years after\n518502 subjects with follow-up',-1,1,-1,1,0,0,'',1,'Measurements taken for: blood pressure, height, weight, sitting height, waist:hip circumference ',0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'','2017-09-15 04:00:00','2017-09-15 04:00:00',2),(72,'Clue Cohort Study- Clue I','CLUE I ','http://www.jhsph.edu/comstockcenter/clue_research_activities.html','Kala Visvanathan','PI, and Director, Clue Studies','410-614-1112','kvisvana@jhu.edu','Judith Hoffman Bolton','Senior Research Program Coordinator','301-797-3589','jhoffma3@jhu.edu',1,'Kala Visvanathan','Johns Hopkins University','kvisvaa@jhu.edu','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','Kala Visvanathan','Principal Investigator, Director Clue Studies','410-614-1112','kvisvana@jhu.edu',1,1,1,'www.jhsph.edu/comstockcenter',0,0,'\nCLUE I - Campaign Against Cancer and Stroke\nFrom August through November 1974, the Campaign against Cancer and Stroke was conducted in Washington County, MD. Referred to as CLUE I (from the slogan \"Give us a Clue to Cancer\"), the study was designed to collect blood samples from as many volunteers  as possible to provide specimens for a serum bank, to \"find out if certain substances in blood serum appear before the onset of cancer and other important diseases\". Mobile trailers were stationed in a wide variety of locations in an effort to give all segments of the community ample opportunity to participate. Among the total of 26,145 persons participating, 23,950 were county residents. Linkage of the records from this program to those of a private census in the summer of 1975 indicated that almost one third of the adult population of the county had participated. Eighty three percent of CLUE I Washington County residents  participated in the 1975 county census providing household data, including smoking, pets, fuel, and drinking water sources. From the supplemental census data a socioeconomic index code and passive smoking code have been determined. \n\nCLUE I participation was best in the age group 35 to 65 years, and was slightly better among females, the better-educated, and nonsmokers. A brief medical history form was completed at the time of blood collection. A medication history (including use of vitamins and hormones) and blood pressure were taken. Blood was drawn into 15 ml Vacutainers, allowed to clot, refrigerated until it was centrifuged, and two 6 ml aliquots of serum were removed for storage at -70°C. The time from blood draw to freezing was usually only a few hours, and never more than 24 hours.\n\nAmong the CLUE I participants, 7849 cases of cancer have developed, with serum remaining from 96 percent of the cases. \n\nCLUE I and II\nOver a third of the participants in CLUE I also participated in CLUE II in 1989 (9111) with 8394 forming the Odyssey Cohort.

It was conducted from May through October 1989. Mobile trailers were used that operated in all areas of the county and at all times of day except between 1 and 6 a.m. Brief medical histories and blood pressure readings were taken, and 20 ml of blood was drawn into heparinized Vacutainers. Specimens were refrigerated at once, and processed within 24 hours. Plasma, buffy coat, and red blood cells have been preserved at -70°C. A total of 32,894 persons participated, of whom 25,079 gave Washington County, MD addresses. Comparisons with published figures from the 1990 Census indicated that  approximately 30 percent of adult residents had participated. As in CLUE I, women and the better educated had higher than average participation rates, as did the age group 45 to 70 years. Data obtained at baseline include age, race, sex, marital status, time since last menstrual period, smoking history, blood pressure, medication use, hormone use, height and weight currently and at age 21. Participants were given a food frequency questionnaire to complete at home and asked to return it (80%) with a toenail clipping for trace metal assays (76%). Cholesterol results were mailed to participants within a few days of blood draw, along with guidelines for physician referral. \nInformation has been collected from this cohort as far back as 1963 and as recently as 2007 from the following sources: private censuses conducted in 1963 and 1975, questionnaires completed at the times of blood donation, and follow-up information from questionnaires administered in 1996, 1998, 2000, 2003, and 2007.\n\nCancer has developed in 8100 CLUE II participants, and plasma remains for 98 percent of these cases.\n\nCLUE I and II\nOver a third of the participants in CLUE I also participated in CLUE II (9132) with 8394 forming the Odyssey Cohort.

It is the only CRC cohort that includes the collection of clinical and risk factor data and the sampling of a diverse panel of biospecimens at multiple critical time points (prior to surgery and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-surgery). This unique design with repeat assessments enables innovative research into the influence of lifestyle/behavioral factors on patient outcomes; ethnic/racial disparities in clinical outcomes; the discovery and validation of novel biomarkers from blood, urine and stool useful for guiding treatment decision-making and risk prediction; and interactions between treatment, risk factors, and biomarkers on clinical outcomes. ColoCare was initiated at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) with subsequent consortium sites at the Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt), German Cancer Research Center (Heidelberg, HBG), and Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) with predominantly institutional start-up funding for patient recruitment. Currently, n=1,600 patients have been recruited. ColoCare has successfully launched research on biologic determinants of CRC (e.g., tumor immunity, gut microbiome, epigenome), health behaviors (e.g., physical activity, adipose tissue distribution), clinical endpoints (e.g., surgical complications), as well as interrelations between these factors in the context of CRC prognosis. To accelerate patient accrual and the greater inclusion of under-represented minority participants, we propose to nearly tripple our current sample size n=5,000 patients, further enhance our data/biospecimen collection at all US sites and include two new sites with high volume of minority populations. In addition, to expand our ability to study energy balance, tumor heterogeneity, and long-term outcomes, we propose additional efforts dedicated to data collection and follow-up. Each ColoCare Study site will leverage existing infrastructure, including access to NCI comprehensive/designated cancer center cores, while utilizing well-established and consistently applied recruitment, data, and biospecimen collection protocols. Patients will be followed up both actively and passively by study staff (in-person and through medical record reviews), as well as via linkages to cancer registry and vital status records.

Over 40,000 women and men from nearly 15,000 families have generously contributed questionnaire data, clinical data and/or biospecimens. Over 150 individual investigators at all stages of their careers, from pre-doctoral students to full professors have used the BCFR resources (using over 200,000 biospecimen samples) since its inception, generating over 300 scientific publications.  \n\nThe BCFR provides an extensive and diverse range of resources, expertise, and specialized skills, and has several unique strengths: 1) the collection of a large number of individuals and families across a wide spectrum of breast cancer risk, including both affected and unaffected individuals; 2) the large collection of families with early-onset breast cancer; 3) the large collection of racial/ethnic minority families not replicated elsewhere; 4) the extensive molecular characterization performed to date; and 5) active follow-up of both probands and family members. Thus, the BCFR comprises a unique cohort of probands and family members at familial/genetic risk of breast cancer that will continue to facilitate a wide range of research studies, such as gene discovery, examination of cancer-related outcomes and risk factors in high-risk subjects, investigation of novel behavioral interventions, and cancer prevention trials among at-risk family members.
